# echo

_echo_ is a system for sending messages between a _client_ and a _server_.

The protocol is being organically designed at this very moment.

## Protocol specification

echo shall be implemented using ZeroMQ sockets. The server binds a
`ROUTER` socket on port 5555 and an arbitrary no. of clients each
connect using a `DEALER` socket.

Upon successful connection from a client, the server expects to
receive a string of characters which it will then send back to the
connecting client.

The server shall tell each time a client connects by logging:

  Connection count {number}

where {number} is the number of connections.

to the console.
