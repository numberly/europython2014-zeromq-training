# Hide and seek


Hider: A hider peer listens on a specific TCP port using a ZeroMQ ROUTER socket and waits for incoming "guess" requests.

Seeker: A seeker peer connects to a known hider peer using a ZeroMQ DEALER socket. A hider peer can be found using the protocol defined in RFC-002.

NOTE: When using RFC-002, the hider peer should register his TCP port number with the broker.

When the seeker peer connects to a hider peer it sends a single string message representing the guessed city name.

The hider peer in turn answers with either a "CORRECT" or "INCORRECT" string message depending on if the guessed city name was in the hider's list of cities or not.
